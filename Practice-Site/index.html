    <h3><a name="Book1">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</a></h3>
    <p class="content">Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start dropping on the doormat at number four, Privet Drive. Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harry’s eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to begin!</p>

        <p id="p5">Quirinus Quirrell was a timid and nervous person, but he was also highly intelligent and gifted. At school he was most likely teased because of his shy nature and made to feel inadequate by others. To try and prove that he wasn’t a nobody, he developed an interest (theoretical at first) in the Dark Arts. That, coupled with his desire to make people take notice of him was what led him to seek out Voldemort.</p>
        <p id="p6">However, Quirrell was immature, arrogant and underestimated Voldemort. He was no match for what remained of the Dark Lord and was possessed by him. While Quirrell still had his soul, he was weakened by having to share his body with an evil, more powerful one.</p>
